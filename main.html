  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to complete its task. It is crucial in assessing the performance of algorithms, helping us identify how the execution time increases with the size of the input. An algorithm with efficient time complexity is desirable, ensuring that it can handle larger datasets or inputs without a significant increase in processing time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Space complexity, on the other hand, evaluates the amount of memory space an algorithm requires concerning the input size. It is often represented using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. In the context of space complexity, the term <b>Space Complexity</b> is used to highlight the focus on memory requirements. Efficient algorithms strike a balance, providing optimal solutions without excessive memory usage.
